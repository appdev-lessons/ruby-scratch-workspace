Hello, for my CMI project, I made
a simple rock-paper-scissors game.
Firstly, the program greets the user and
asks both player to type in their moves
After that, the outcime of the game is shown.
Both users are then given the option to play
again and type in their moves again. The users
can keep playing agian and again until they tell the
program that they are done playing.

Note: After each game, the program also shows
the number of game played, the number of times
player one won, and the number of times player two won!
