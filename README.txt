- Ruby version: 3.2.1

Hello, for my Command Line Interface (CLI) project,

I made a simple rock-paper-scissors game. Firstly, the program greets the user and asks the player what he/she would like to play (rock, paper, or scissors). After that, the computer (CPU) plays its move and depending on the moves made either the Player or the CPU win (or there is a tie)! After that, the user is given the option to play another round.

Note: After each game, the program also shows the number of game played, the number of times player one won, and the number of times player two won!

Another note: The player can type 'help' to get instructions on how to play rock paper scissors and use this interface.

Thanks for reading this, and enjoy!
